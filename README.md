# Last Act of Love Short Animation Film
The objective of this project is to conceive, design, and produce a captivating animated sequence through combining artistic vision and technological expertise. By employing several techniques using Blender (open-source 3D computer graphics software tool), we were able to bring a heartfelt story to life.

# Main Story
The implementation included several phases, commencing with brainstorming to come 
up with a compelling narrative and a plot that resonated with the audience, drawing 
inspiration from an existing TV series known as Love, Death & Robots, we decided to 
mimic the apocalyptic nature of the series, where KIPP, a lonely robot who wanders in 
the ruins of the city finds another robot, Eve, lying on the ground, he soon realizes that 
her battery has been depleted, so he decides to go looking for a battery in hopes of 
finding one, despite his search, he fails to find another, left with no alternative, he decides 
to replenish the robot's power using his battery and despite nearly draining his own 
the power source in the process, the act fills his (hypothetical) heart with immense joy. Eve 
wakes up and they stroll together in the city, and they share some quality time together, 
later KIPP starts showing symptoms of tiredness, but Eve doesn’t realize that. 
Unfortunately, the robot doesn’t hold up for much afterward, he falls to his demise 
leaving the other robot all alone, later, it is shown that there is a battery behind one 
of the rocks after all and so teaches us to never leave a stone unturned as it might cost us 
our life.
